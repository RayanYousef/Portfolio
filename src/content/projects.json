Future updates will add Two-Way Binding for greater interactivity.\n\n## Dependencies\nNo required dependencies\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd this package to your Unity project as a Git-based package:\n\n```bash\nhttps://github.com/RayanYousef/MVVM-Unity.git\n```\n\nOpen Unity and go to **Window > Package Manager**, select **+ > Add package from git URL…**, and paste the link above.\n\n\n## Usage Guide\n\nThis MVVM framework provides base classes and interfaces to streamline setting up a model-view-viewmodel architecture in Unity. You can either:\n- Extend the provided base classes for convenience.\n- Or, if you need more control, implement the interfaces directly.\n\n### Step 1: Implementing Model, ViewModel, and View Classes\n\nThis MVVM framework provides flexibility in setting up `Model`, `ViewModel`, and `View` components. You can either:\n\n- **Extend the provided base classes** (`ViewModelBase` and `ViewBase<TViewModel>`) for a quick setup with built-in functionality.\n- **Or, implement the interfaces** (`IModel`, `IViewModel`, and `IView`) directly if you need more customization.\n\n> If you implement the interfaces, ensure correct implementation of the required interfaces to maintain seamless communication between the components.\n\n### Example: Setting Up a Simple Model\n\nTo illustrate, here’s a basic `StatsModel` example:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\nnamespace AdorableAssets.MVVM\n{\n    [Serializable]\n    public class StatsModel : IModel\n    {\n        public PropertyUpdatedEvent OnPropertyUpdated { get; set; }\n        private int _health;\n        \n        public int Health\n        {\n            get => _health;\n            set\n            {\n                if (_health != value)\n                {\n                    _health = value;\n                    OnPropertyUpdated?.Invoke(\"Health\", _health);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis simple `StatsModel` example:\n- Declares a `Health` property.\n- Raises the `OnPropertyUpdated` event when `Health` changes, ensuring updates can be reflected in the view.\n\n### Step 2: Creating a ViewModel\n\nTo use this model, create a `ViewModel` by extending `ViewModelBase`:\n\n```csharp\npublic class StatsViewModel : ViewModelBase<StatsModel>\n{\n    // Optionally, add ViewModel-specific methods here\n}\n```\n\n\n### Step 3: Setting Up a View\n\nTo display data in Unity, create a `View` class by extending `ViewBase<TViewModel>`.\n\n#### 1. Binding UI Components to Model Properties\n\n```csharp\npublic class PlayerHealthView : ViewBase<StatsViewModel>\n{\n    protected override void RegisterBindings()\n    {\n        BindingManager\n            .ForComponent<Image>(\"HealthBarImage\", healthBarImage => healthBarImage.fillAmount)\n            .ToProperties(\"Health\")\n            .OneWay();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n> In the Unity Editor, assign the **Image** component (or the GameObject containing the **Image** component) to the corresponding field. You can then bind it by using the **component name** and **type** with `ForComponent<Type>(\"Component Name\", ...)`. \n<div align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ohSnanA3sMA5oKkoyEjXkh_doIpLarEf\"  height =\"350\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"/>\n</div>\n\n#### 2. Binding Multiple Components to the Same View\n\nIn some cases, you might want to bind multiple components to the same View. Below is an example where multiple UI elements from the same GameObject are bound to different properties of the `StatsViewModel`. This allows you to manage several visual elements at once with a single `View` class.\n\n#### HealthBar Class\n\nFirst, let’s define the `HealthBar` class which holds references to the `Image` and `Text` components:\n\n```csharp\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing UnityEngine.UI;\n\nnamespace AdorableAssets.MVVM\n{\n    public class HealthBar : MonoBehaviour\n    {\n        [SerializeField] private Image _healthBarFillImage;\n        [SerializeField] private Text _healthValueText;\n\n        public Image HealthBarFillImage  => _healthBarFillImage;\n        public Text HealthValueText  => _healthValueText; \n    }\n}\n```\n\n> The `HealthBar` class contains serialized fields for the `Image` and `Text` components that will be linked in the Unity Editor. These fields are used in the `View` class to set up bindings between the UI and the model properties.\n\n#### PlayerHealthView Class\n\nNow, let’s set up the `PlayerHealthView` class to bind multiple components (such as the health bar fill, color, and text) to different properties of the `StatsViewModel`.\n\n```csharp\npublic class PlayerHealthView : ViewBase<StatsViewModel>\n{\n    [SerializeField] private HealthBar _healthBar;\n\n    protected override void RegisterBindings()\n    {\n        // Binding health percentage to the fill amount of the HealthBar\n        BindingManager\n            .ForComponent<HealthBar>(\"PlayerHealthBar\", healthBar => healthBar.HealthBarFillImage.fillAmount)\n            .ToProperties(EnumStatTypes.HealthPercentage.ToString())\n            .OneWay();\n\n        // Binding health percentage to the color of the HealthBar's fill image\n        BindingManager\n            .ForComponent<HealthBar>(\"PlayerHealthBar\", healthBar => healthBar.HealthBarFillImage.color)\n            .ToProperties(EnumStatTypes.HealthPercentage.ToString())\n            .UsingExpression(value =>\n            {\n                Color colorToReturn = Color.Lerp(Color.red, Color.green, (float)value);\n                return colorToReturn;\n            })\n            .OneWay();\n\n        // Binding health percentage to the color of the Health Value Text\n        BindingManager\n            .ForComponent<HealthBar>(\"PlayerHealthBar\", healthBar => healthBar.HealthValueText.color)\n            .ToProperties(EnumStatTypes.HealthPercentage.ToString())\n            .UsingExpression(value =>\n            {\n                Color colorToReturn = Color.Lerp(Color.black, Color.white, (float)value);\n                return colorToReturn;\n            })\n            .OneWay();\n\n        // Binding health and max health to the Health Value Text\n        BindingManager\n            .ForComponent<HealthBar>(\"PlayerHealthBar\", healthBar => healthBar.HealthValueText.text)\n            .ToProperties(EnumStatTypes.Health.ToString(), EnumStatTypes.MaxHealth.ToString())\n            .UsingExpression(value =>\n            {\n                string valueToReturn =\n                ViewModel.Health\n                + \"/\"\n                + ViewModel.MaxHealth;\n                return valueToReturn;\n            })\n            .OneWay();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n> In this example, multiple UI components from the same `HealthBar` GameObject are bound to properties from the `ViewModel`:\n> - The `HealthBarFillImage.fillAmount` is bound to the `HealthPercentage` property.\n> - The `HealthBarFillImage.color` and `HealthValueText.color` change based on the health percentage.\n> - The `HealthValueText.text` is bound to the player's health and max health.\n\n**This example is included within the asset**, and you can refer to it to see how multiple components can be bound to the same View. The `HealthBar` and `PlayerHealthView` classes are provided to help you understand how to work with bindings and UI components effectively."

It eliminates the need for an extra camera, saving your game's performance. Setting up and using \"Camera Free Minimap\" is incredibly straightforward.<br/>\n**It Supports Procedurally Generated Maps.**\n\n## KEY FEATURE:\n### Single Camera Usage: \nThe Camera Free Minimap asset allows you to create a \nminimap without the need for a second camera. This feature is essential for \nimproving performance in your Unity projects, as it eliminates the overhead \nassociated with rendering a secondary camera view.\n### Ease of Setup: \nSetting up the Camera Free Minimap is straightforward and user friendly. You can quickly integrate it into your project, making it accessible for \ndevelopers of all skill levels.\nIn-Depth Script Comments: The included scripts are well-documented with \ndetailed comments. This makes it easier for developers to understand and \ncustomize the minimap behavior according to their project requirements.\n### Two Variants: \nThis asset provides two distinct minimap variants:\n<br/>• Follow Target Minimap:<br/> You can create a dynamic minimap that follows a \nspecific object that you specify. This is valuable for games where you want \nthe minimap to focus on a moving character or object.\n<br/>• Static Minimap:<br/> Alternatively, you can use the static minimap version for \ngames that don't require dynamic minimap tracking. This mode offers a \nfixed overview of the game world.\n\n## HOW DOES IT WORK?\nCamera Free Minimap simplifies the process of creating a minimap for your Unity \nproject. To understand how it operates, let's break it down into key steps:\n### World Size Determination: \nCamera Free Minimap requires knowledge of your \ngame world's dimensions. This means it needs to know the minimum and \nmaximum X and Z coordinates of your world.\n### Utilizing the \"World Map\" Prefab: \nThe asset relies on a specific prefab called \n\"World Map,\" which can be found in the prefab folders. This prefab plays a crucial \nrole in generating the minimap.\n### Establishing a Connection with the Minimap Image: \nThe \"World Map\" prefab \nneeds a reference to your minimap image. The minimap image typically resides \nwithin the Canvas hierarchy. This connection is vital for the minimap generation \nprocess.\n### Mapping the Minimap Image to \"World Map\": \nOnce linked, the \"World Map\" \nextracts the sprite from your minimap image. It attaches this sprite to itself using \na Sprite Renderer component.\n### Projection of the Minimap in the World: \nAs a result of this action, your minimap \nimage becomes a visual representation projected into the game world.\n### Alignment with the Game World: \nTo ensure the minimap matches your game's \nenvironment, you need to align the \"World Map\" with your world's structures and \nlayout. This alignment ensures that the minimap reflects the in-game world \ncorrectly.\n### Calculating World Dimensions: \nThe \"World Map\" now possesses the ability to \ncalculate the size of your world along the X and Z axes. This information becomes \nessential for determining the position of various elements within the minimap.\n### Calculating Minimap Dimensions: \nUsing the corners of any UI elements you can determine its dimensions, with that we can calculate the dimensions of the minimap in the UI.<br/>\nKnowing the world dimensions and the minimap dimensions the minimap now you can determine the position of the UI elements on the minimap!\n\n## Documentation Link:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1cMswtkUeIzoFR40DU381zZGATX-FvOhJ/view?usp=drive_link\n\n## Your Feedback is Appreciated\nI'm eager to continue working on and enhancing this asset, and I would greatly appreciate your feedback.<br/>\nFeel free to reach out to me through:<br/>\nEmail: RayanYoussef1993@gmail.com <br/>\nDiscord: rayan_1431\n\n\n\n\n## Feel free to utilize the asset and customize the code to perfectly align with your specific requirements.\n"
